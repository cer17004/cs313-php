            <p> Hey Everyone! My name is Rachelle Ceron and I'm excited to do this course with you guys this 
                semester! I am currently majoring in Computer Science and I am excited about all my 
                courses this semester. One interesting thing about me is that I am currently taking more 
                math classes than I need, it's actually my hobby lol. <br> <br>
                Something else interesting about me outside of school is that I have a passion for reading. I recently
                just got back into it and I think that I am on my 5th book in two weeks. It is how I choose to 
                relax from doing hw at the end of the night. Another thing that I do that is more active is that 
                I love to go dancing and hopefully after this quarantine is over I can go dancing with those
                that I love again. <br><br> I'm looking forward to learning in this class!
